tokumei-recaptcha
=================

reCAPTCHA apps for [Tokumei](https://tokumei.co/).

`recaptcha`: common templating required for the other apps.

`posts_recaptcha`: `posts` app modified to require solving a reCAPTCHA challenge
before posting. Requires `recaptcha` and `indices_recaptcha`.

`replies_recaptcha`: `replies` app modified to require solving a reCAPTCHA
challenge before posting. Requires `recaptcha`.

`indices_recaptcha`: `indices` app modified to use `posts_recaptcha` instead of
`posts`. Requires `recaptcha` and `posts_recaptcha`.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Put the directories for the apps you want under tokumei/apps/. If you used
   the Tokumei installer, this is /var/www/YOUR-DOMAIN.TLD/apps/.

    mv recaptcha posts_recaptcha replies_recaptcha indices_recaptcha /path/to/tokumei/apps/

2. Generate a reCAPTCHA API key. Note that you need to set the security
   preference to "easiest for users" if you want your Tokumei site to work
   without JavaScript (recommended). Google should give you a site key and a
   secret which you'll use to configure tokumei-recaptcha.

3. Configure reCAPTCHA in tokumei/sites/tokumei.co/_werc/config. Remove the apps
   you are replacing (probably posts, replies, and indices), enable the new apps
   you want, and set `recaptchasitekey` and `recaptchasecret` using the site key
   and secret you got in step 2.

    +conf_enable_recaptcha

    +recaptchasitekey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    +recaptchasecret=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

4. Clear Tokumei's template cache.
